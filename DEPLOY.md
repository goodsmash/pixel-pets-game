# Deployment Instructions for GitHub

## Manual Git Setup

Since automated Git operations are restricted, please run these commands manually in your terminal:

### 1. Clean Git State
```bash
# Remove any lock files if they exist
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/config.lock

# Check current status
git status
```

### 2. Add Remote Repository
```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/goodsmash/pixel-pets-game.git

# Or if remote already exists, update it
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/goodsmash/pixel-pets-game.git
```

### 3. Stage All Files
```bash
# Add all project files to Git
git add .

# Check what files are staged
git status
```

### 4. Create Initial Commit
```bash
# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Pixel Pets Game with AI-powered breeding and DALL-E 3 integration

- ✅ Complete React/TypeScript frontend with shadcn/ui
- ✅ Express.js backend with Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL
- ✅ DALL-E 3 integration for HD pet image generation
- ✅ Advanced breeding system with genetic trait inheritance
- ✅ Google Gemini AI for exploration and pet personalities
- ✅ Comprehensive crafting and trading systems
- ✅ Real-time gameplay features and progression mechanics"
```

### 5. Push to GitHub
```bash
# Push to main branch (create if doesn't exist)
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Environment Variables for Production

Create a `.env` file on your production server with:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your-google-ai-api-key-here
NODE_ENV=production
```
