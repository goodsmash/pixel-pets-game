# Push to GitHub - Step by Step Guide

## Your project is ready for GitHub! Follow these steps:

### 1. Create a new repository on GitHub
- Go to https://github.com/new
- Repository name: `pixel-pets-game` (or your preferred name)
- Description: `AI-powered virtual pet game with breeding, battles, and exploration`
- Keep it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
- **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
- Click "Create repository"

### 2. Copy the repository URL
After creating the repository, copy the HTTPS URL (it will look like):
`https://github.com/yourusername/pixel-pets-game.git`

### 3. Open Shell in Replit and run these commands:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/pixel-pets-game.git

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit your project
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI-powered pixel pet game with comprehensive features"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. If you get authentication errors:
You may need to use a Personal Access Token instead of password:

1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with 'repo' permissions
3. Use your username and the token as password when prompted

### Alternative using GitHub CLI (if available):
```bash
gh repo create pixel-pets-game --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```
